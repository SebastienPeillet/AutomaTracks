about=Automatic tracks based on least cost path algorithm. This method fits to road planification in french guyana forest. It needs ridge polyline, that will be converted into path points. The algorithm makes least cost path based on earthwork (m3) that will be needed to build the road between the points. For more informations, DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.23880.42243
